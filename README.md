🚀 Introduction
This project demonstrates my implementation of a production-grade monitoring and alerting stack using Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager on Kubernetes — adding full observability to my CI/CD Deployment Pipeline project.
As part of my DevOps engineering portfolio — building on containerisation, orchestration, and CI/CD from my previous projects — this project completes the DevOps lifecycle by answering the critical question: "How do you know your application is healthy in production?"
📋 Project Overview
Objective: Deploy a complete observability stack that collects application and infrastructure metrics, visualises them in real-time dashboards, and triggers alerts when things go wrong.
